Compilation
-----------

After installation, you can use pkg-config to compile these tests.
For example, to compile random-test-slave run:

gcc random-test-slave.c -o random-test-slave `pkg-config --libs --cflags modbus`

random-test-slave
-----------------
It's necessary to launch this server before run random-test-master. By
default, it receives and responses to Modbus query on the localhost
and port 1502.

random-test-master
------------------
This programm sends many different queries to a large range of
addresses and values to test the communication between the master and
the slave.

unit-test-slave
unit-test-master
----------------
By default, this program sends some queries with the values defined in
unit-test.h and checks the responses. These programs are useful to
test the protocol implementation.

bench-bandwidth-slave
bench-bandwidth-master
----------------------
It returns some very useful informations about the performance of
transfert rate between the slave and the master.
